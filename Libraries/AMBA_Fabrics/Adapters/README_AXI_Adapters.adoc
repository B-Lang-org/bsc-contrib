for general introduction and about compiling/building/testing.

This directory describes adapters between AXI4 and AXI4-Lite.

These source codes may import other `bsv-contrib` libraries; be sure
they are visible in your _bsc_ compiler paths:

    bsc-contrib/Libraries/AMBA_Fabrics/Utils/
    bsc-contrib/Libraries/Misc/

These source codes may import other `bsv-contrib` libraries; be sure

The packages in this directory can be used as-is, but are expected to
be restructured to be more like their AXI4 siblings (more consistent
naming, clean separation of B-Lang-style and RTL-style, etc.)

This documentation will be updated after that restructuring.

// ================================================================
== `AXI4L_S_to_AXI4_M_Adapter.bsv`

A module to bridge from an AXI4-Lite S to an AXI4 M.

(... To be written ...)

// ================================================================
== Unit tests

Unit tests will be found in:

    bsc-contrib/testing/bsc.contrib/AMBA_Fabrics/Adapters/Test_*.bsv

The conventions for unit tests are described in more detail in the
README in the parent directory
(link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.adoc[adoc],link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.html[html]).
