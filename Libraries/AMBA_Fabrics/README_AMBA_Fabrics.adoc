== Introduction

This directory contains libraries for various AMBA resources (AXI4,
AXI4-Lite, AXI4_Stream) including type definitions, cross-bar
switches, connectors, clock-crossers, and edge-transactors to connect
the B-Lang world to existing RTL (e.g., external AMBA IP).

The source code is written in a B-Lang (BSV/BH/Bluespec Classic).  The
free and open-source _bsc_ compiler tool can be used to generate
synthesizable Verilog (https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc[]).

The origins of this code date at least as far back as 2018 inside
https://bluespec.com[Bluespec, Inc.]  The codes have evolved over time
and various versions have been used and are still in use in numerous
RISC-V CPUs and SoC designs at several universities and companies,
including in commercialized ASICs.  The codes were moved to this
repository in November-December 2024.

CAUTION: In moving these codes to this repository, they are being
         further cleaned up, so there may be a short period of
         instability. The cleanups to the `AXI4/` directory have been
         completed; cleanups to `AXI4_Lite` and `AXI4_Stream`
         directories are ongoing.  We will remove this CAUTION when
         that work is completed.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
=== Terminology:

Since 2021 ARM has replaced the terms "Master" and "Slave" by
"Manager" and "Subordinate", respectively; in this library we just use
"M" and "S" for these concepts.  An M sends requests (on AW, W, AR)
and recieves responses (on B, R). An S recieves requests (on AW, W,
AR) and sends responses (on B, R).

In this library, identifiers use `AXI4` for AXI4 itsef, `AXI4L` for
AXI4-Lite, and `AXI4S` for AXI4-Stream, three distinct parts of the
AMBA AXI spec.

// ================================================================
== Principles

=== Background on ARM AMBA AXI

AXI4 and AXI4-Lite are specifications of buses, each with five
independent "channels" (AW, W, B, AR, R).

ARM's specs are described at the signal (RTL) level).  Each channel
has multiple sub-buses (e.g., awaddr, awsize, arlen, bresp, rdata,
...)  and is unidirectional (all sub-buses carry data in the same
direction).  Each channel is independently flow-controlled with a
traditional handshake on two additional wires called `ready` (receiver
to sender) and `valid` (sender-to-receiver). Please see "RTL view" in
diagram below.

For a write-transaction, the sender sends information on AW (address
etc.) and W (data etc.), and receives a response on B (status etc.).
For a read-transaction, the sender sends information on AR (address
etc.) and receives a response on R (status, data, etc.).

Please see ARM's specs for full details of the channels, sub-buses,
ready-valid handshaking, and detailed semantics of transactions.

=== B-Lang view vs. RTL view

In BSV/BH/Bluespec Classic the natural way to do unidirectional
flow-controlled communication is with FIFOs.  Further, groups of
related data values are naturally represented as "structs".  Further,
complex interfaces can contain sub-interfaces.

Thus, AMBA AXI is represented in BSV as shown in "B-Lang view" in the
diagram below.  Each of the groups AW, W, B, AR, R is defined as a
`struct` with fields corresponding to the sub-buses of the group.
Each struct is communicated as a unit from sender to receiver with
FIFO buffers.  An M interface (`AXI4_M_IFC`) contains five
sub-interfaces, each corresponding to one end of a FIFO ("enqueue" end
or "dequeue" end).  An S interface (`AXI4_S_IFC`) is the dual, using
the opposite ends of FIFOs.  A one-line `mkConnection` is sufficient
to connect two such interfaces together.

As long as one is working within a B-Lang, that is the complete story
on bus representation.  However, if it is necessary to connect to
RTL-level AXI IP---Verilog/SystemVerilog buses, sub-buses, and
ready-valid handshaking--- we provide two "transactors"
`mkAXI4_BSV_to_RTL` (BSV M to RTL S) and `mkAXI4_RTL_to_BSV` (RTL M to
BSV S) to perform the conversions. Each transactor has a B-Lang-view
interface on one side and an RTL-view interface on the other side.
These transactors are written in BSV, but when compiled by the _bsc_
compiler, will produced RTL signals and logic with the correct signal
names and ready-valid handshaking.  Within B-Lang, a one-line
`mkConnection` is sufficient to connect `AXI4_RTL_M_IFC` and
`AXI4_RTL_S_IFC` interfaces.

CAUTION: In these AXI4 resources, WRAP bursts are not supported.
         Where bursts are supported, it generally assumes INCR
         (incrementing) bursts or FIXED.

== Directory structure and links to details

The source tree for this library is:

    bsc-contrib_RSN/
    └── Libraries/
        └── AMBA_Fabrics/
            ├── README_AMBA_Fabrics.txt
            ├── AXI4/
            ├── AXI4_Lite/
            ├── AXI4_Stream/
            ├── Adapters/
            ├── Utils/
            └── Makefile

The code in `AXI4` is a substantially cleaned up version of existing
codes that have been used in a number of projects.  The cleanup
involved consistent naming, clean separation of B-Lang-view and
RTL-view, externalizing of buffering choices, etc.

The code in `AXI4_Lite`, `AXI4_Stream`, and `Adapters` are also
snapshots of existing codes that have been used in a number of
projects (and so they can be used, as-is), but they have not yet gone
through the analogous cleanup, which is a work-in-progress.

Please see READMEs in each directory for specifics of directory
contents:

== Compiling/Building/Testing

You can compile these libraries from source using the _bsc_ compiler
as part of your own compile/build flow, by making sure the files you
need are in located in your _bsc_ compiler search path.

NOTE: Some of these files require the `-aggressive-conditions` flag (else may deadlock).

The Makefiles in this library can be used if you wish to pre-compile
these files using the _bsc_ compiler, by doing:

    $ make install

This will invoke _bsc_ and place the resulting `.bo` files in:

    bsc-contrib/inst/lib/Libraries/AMBA_Fabrics/...

There are several "unit tests" for this library located in:

    bsc-contrib_RSN/
    └── testing/
        └── bsc.contrib/
            ├── AMBA_Fabrics_AXI4/
            ├── AMBA_Fabrics_AXI4_Lite/
            ...

Each directory, `Makefile`, script fragment (`foo.exp` file) and
expected output (`foo.out.expected` file) is set up for the CI
(Continuous Integration) flow that is run repeatedly for the _bsc_
compiler.  Please see the "How to Contribute to bsc-contrib" document
(link:../../doc/How_to_Contribute.adoc[adoc],
link:../../doc/How_to_Contribute.html[html]) for details on this
setup.
