Pleae see README in parent directory
(link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.adoc[adoc],link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.html[html])
for general introduction and about compiling/building/testing.

This directory describes AXI4-Lite facilities, including type definitions,
cross-bar switches, connectors, clock-crossers, and edge-transactors
to connect the B-Lang world to existing RTL (e.g., external AMBA IP).

These source codes may import other `bsv-contrib` libraries; be sure
they are visible in your _bsc_ compiler paths:

    bsc-contrib/Libraries/AMBA_Fabrics/Utils/
    bsc-contrib/Libraries/Misc/

The packages in this directory can be used as-is, but are expected to
be restructured to be more like their AXI4 siblings (more consistent
naming, clean separation of B-Lang-style and RTL-style, etc.)

This documentation will be updated after that restructuring.

// ================================================================
== General

Many of these modules take an upstream `AXI4L_M_IFC` and/or a
downstream `AXI4L_S_IFC` as a module parameter.  Thus, the actual FIFO
buffers producing these interfaces are external, allowing a choice of
buffering alternatives.

All these have a 'user' field which is not standard in AXI4-Lite (same
role as 'user' in AXI4), which can be left unused, and/or set to width
0.

// ================================================================
== `AXI4_Lite_Types.bsv`

Definitions for AXI4_Lite bus types, M and S interfaces, connections
between Ms and Ss, dummy M and S tie-offs, and transactors to provide
higher-level FIFO-like interfaces to drive Ms and Ss.

Everything is parameterizd on width of address, data and user buses.

Note: some aspects of these definitions may seem a bit verbose and
messy; that is not typical of BSV code, but is true here because it is
meant to interface to hand-written Verilog, so we need to provide
precise control on interface signal names and protocols that are
required by the Verilog side.  Pure BSV code can be an order of
magnitude more compact.

Everything is parameterized on wd_addr, wd_data, wd_user.

== `AXI4_Lite_Fabric.bsv`

NOTE: Needs _bsc_ `-aggressive-conditions` flag (else will deadlock).

Definition for interface and module for an num_M x num_S crossbar
switch with AXI4-Lite interfaces.

This is also an example of how, within BSV code, we don't worry about
the details of AXI4-Lite signalling. We just instantiate the
transactors defined in AXI4_Lite_Types.bsv, and then work only with
simple, FIFO-like interfaces.

Everything is parameterized on num_M, num_S, wd_addr, wd_data,
wd_user.

== Unit tests

There are some unit tests in:

    bsc-contrib/testing/bsc.contrib/AMBA_Fabrics/AXI4_Lite/Test_*.bsv

The conventions for unit tests are described in more detail in the
README in the parent directory
(link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.adoc[adoc],link:../README_AMBA_Fabrics.html[html]).
